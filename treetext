Talks
to
boost
EU’s
financial
‘bazooka’.
Eleventh-hour
negotiations
have
begun
to
create
a
much
bigger
financial
“bazooka”
to
present
at
this
week’s
European
Union
summit
that
could
include
running
two
separate
rescue
funds
and
winning
increased
support
for
the
International
Monetary
Fund.
This
three-pronged
rescue
system
would
form
part
of
a
crafted
package
EU
leaders
hope
will
win
over
financial
markets,
just
two
months
after
a
similar
summit
failed
to
convince
bond
investors
Europe
could
contain
its
spiralling
debt
crisis.
The
rescue
system
would
be
introduced
alongside
proposals
to
rewrite
EU
treaties
with
far
tougher
budget
rules
for
the
eurozone.
According
to
senior
European
officials,
negotiators
are
considering
allowing
the
eurozone’s
existing
€440bn
bail-out
fund
to
continue
running
when
a
new
€500bn
facility
comes
into
force
in
mid-2012,
almost
doubling
the
firepower
of
the
bloc’s
financial
rescue
system.
The
proposal,
being
debated
by
“sherpas”
ahead
of
Thursday’s
crucial
eurozone
summit,
could
also
include
speeding
up
cash
payments
into
the
new
€500bn
fund
–
known
as
the
European
Stability
Mechanism
–
to
give
it
more
heft
and
improve
its
creditworthiness
in
the
eyes
of
credit
rating
agencies.
Supporters
of
the
proposals
acknowledge
they
are
controversial
and
the
subject
of
intense
debate
by
officials
negotiating
new
ESM
treaty
language.
Some
northern
creditor
countries,
where
bail-out
backlash
has
threatened
to
topple
national
governments,
have
shown
reluctance.
But
the
proposals’
backers
argue
that
allowing
the
ESM
to
run
alongside
the
current
bail-out
fund
could
strengthen
Europe’s
financial
firewall
when
combined
with
new
eurozone
funds
for
the
IMF
to
increase
its
capacity
to
aid
struggling
countries.
The
current
bail-out
fund,
known
as
the
European
Financial
Stability
Facility,
was
originally
supposed
to
wind
down
when
the
ESM
came
into
place.
Under
the
plans
being
considered,
the
ESM
is
unlikely
to
have
its
headline
€500bn
from
the
start,
now
envisioned
for
July.
But
leveraging
up
the
existing
EFSF,
which
could
raise
disposable
resources
to
about
€600bn,
and
adding
new
IMF
and
ESM
resources
could
create
the
so-called
“bazooka”
effect
leaders
are
searching
for.
Creating
a
credible
financial
firewall
has
been
a
key
demand
by
Mario
Draghi,
president
of
the
European
Central
Bank.
Brazilian
growth
shudders
to
a
halt.
Brazil’s
economy
stalled
in
the
third
quarter
of
this
year,
demonstrating
the
vulnerability
of
the
world’s
emerging
market
growth
engines
to
the
slowdown
in
the
developed
world.
Gross
domestic
product
failed
to
grow
in
the
three
months
ended
September
30
compared
with
the
previous
quarter
as
weakness
in
the
industrial
sector
spread
to
Brazil’s
once
vibrant
consumer.
“Consumption
is
really
slowing
down
–
it’s
no
longer
something
that
people
feared
might
happen,
it’s
gradually
being
realised,”
said
George
Lei,
an
economist
with
Nomura
in
New
York.
The
sharp
deterioration
in
growth
in
Brazil
poses
political
challenges
for
Brazil’s
president
Dilma
Rousseff
and
comes
as
China
reported
last
week
that
manufacturing
activity
in
November
contracted
for
the
first
time
in
almost
three
years.
China,
Brazil
and
India,
the
three
largest
emerging
economies,
are
all
now
slowing,
according
to
their
latest
GDP
figures.
The
eurozone
crisis
is
hitting
confidence
while
economic
slowdown
in
Europe
and
the
US
is
undermining
demand
both
for
manufactured
goods
from
emerging
markets
and
for
the
minerals
produced
by
resource-rich
countries
such
as
Brazil.
Other
big
emerging
economies,
notably
Russia
and
Indonesia,
posted
increases
in
third
quarter
growth,
though
even
in
these
economies
the
authorities
see
a
looming
slowdown.
Emerging
market
growth
rates
are
forecast
to
remain
much
higher
than
in
the
developed
world,
with
China,
for
example,
predicted
to
grow
at
about
8
per
cent
in
2012.
The
Asian
Development
Bank
on
Tuesday
forecast
east
Asia’s
economic
growth
next
year
would
slightly
drop
to
7.2
per
cent,
with
a
worst
case
scenario
of
5.4
per
cent.
But
economists
are
concerned
that
will
not
be
enough
to
rescue
the
world
economy.
Clinton
seeks
closer
Burma
ties.
Hillary
Clinton,
US
secretary
of
state,
vowed
to
reward
tentative
reforms
by
Burma’s
authoritarian
government
and
work
towards
opening
a
“new
chapter”
in
relations
between
the
two
countries.
After
meeting
Thein
Sein,
Burma’s
president,
however,
Mrs
Clinton
yesterday
said
it
was
still
too
soon
to
lift
the
tough
economic
sanctions
that
have
added
to
the
country’s
isolation
and
impoverishment.
Mrs
Clinton
told
Mr
Thein
Sein
Washington
was
“encouraged”
by
the
steps
undertaken
in
recent
months
as
Burma
seeks
to
emerge
from
50
years
of
repressive
military
rule.
She
said
the
US
would
support
an
increase
in
international
aid,
a
greater
role
for
the
World
Bank
and
was
considering
returning
an
ambassador
to
the
country.
In
talks
she
described
as
“candid
[and]
productive”,
Mrs
Clinton
also
urged
Mr
Thein
Sein,
a
former
general,
to
speed
up
the
release
of
political
prisoners,
seek
an
end
to
decades
of
violent
conflict
with
some
ethnic
groups
and
cease
its
dealings
with
North
Korea,
which
some
analysts
fear
may
incorporate
an
illicit
weapons
programme.
“The
president
told
me
he
hopes
to
build
on
these
steps,
and
I
assured
him
that
these
reforms
have
our
support,”
Mrs
Clinton
said
after
the
talks
in
Burma’s
remote
capital,
Naypyitaw,
according
to
Reuters.
“I
also
made
clear
that,
while
the
measures
already
taken
may
be
unprecedented
and
welcomed,
they
are
just
the
beginning.
“We’re
not
at
the
point
yet
where
we
can
consider
lifting
sanctions
that
we
have
in
place
because
of
our
ongoing
concerns
about
policies
that
have
to
be
reversed,”
Mrs
Clinton
told
reporters,
according
to
Associated
Press.
“But
any
steps
that
the
government
takes
will
be
carefully
considered
and
will
be
matched.”
Mrs
Clinton,
the
most
senior
US
official
to
visit
Burma
in
more
than
50
years,
was
sent
by
Barack
Obama,
US
president,
to
“test
the
true
intentions”
of
the
leadership
and
deepen
bilateral
ties
in
order
to
balance
China’s
growing
influence
in
the
resource-rich
nation
of
about
60m
people.
Nomura
dumps
eurozone
debt.
Nomura
has
reduced
its
exposure
to
countries
in
the
eurozone
periphery
by
75
per
cent
in
the
past
two
months
in
a
move
that
highlights
concerns
about
the
growing
risk
of
holding
eurozone
periphery
government
debt
amid
the
region’s
crisis.
The
Japanese
investment
bank
said
it
had
cut
its
country
exposure
to
Greece,
Ireland,
Italy,
Portugal
and
Spain
from
$3.55bn
at
the
end
of
September
to
$884m
by
last
Thursday.
Nomura
said
it
had
slashed
its
exposure
to
Italy,
in
particular,
by
83
per
cent
from
$2.8bn
to
$467m.
“We
have
significantly
reduced
our
GIIPS
exposure
as
part
an
effort
to
proactively
manage
our
risk
profile
during
this
period
of
market
instability,”
the
bank
said
on
Monday.
The
move
comes
as
Nomura
has
faced
growing
concerns
about
its
ability
to
generate
profits
after
it
posted
an
unexpectedly
large
Y46.1bn
($591m)
loss
in
the
second
quarter.
The
bank
has
been
placed
on
review
by
Moody’s,
which
warns
that
its
rating
could
be
lowered
to
just
one
notch
above
junk.
The
bank
has
unveiled
a
$1.2bn
cost-cutting
exercise
in
a
bid
to
lower
its
break-even
point
and
is
seeking
buyers
for
non-core
business
assets.
Nomura
is
not
the
only
Japanese
institution
that
has
slashed
its
exposure
to
eurozone
periphery
countries
on
concerns
about
the
outlook
for
the
region,
as
Italian
bond
yields
exceeded
7
per
cent.
Separately,
Kokusai
Asset
Management,
which
manages
Japan’s
largest
investment
trust,
the
Global
Sovereign
fund,
said
it
had
sold
all
its
Italian,
Spanish
and
Belgian
sovereign
bonds.
Technocrat
cabinet
takes
helm
in
Rome.
Italy’s
caretaker
government
of
unelected
technocrats
led
by
Mario
Monti
took
charge
of
the
eurozone’s
third-biggest
economy
yesterday
to
the
applause
of
Europe’s
leaders
and
scepticism
of
investors.
Acknowledging
the
weight
of
the
eurozone
on
his
shoulders,
the
68-year-old
economics
professor
took
on
the
additional
responsibility
of
running
the
finance
ministry
in
a
slimmed-down
17-member
cabinet.
He
also
appointed
Corrado
Passera,
head
of
Intesa
Sanpaolo,
Italy’s
largest
retail
bank,
as
head
of
a
“super
ministry”
combining
industry
and
infrastructure,
reflecting
the
new
government’s
emphasis
on
reforms
to
lift
the
stagnating
economy.
“All
this
will,
I
trust,
translate
into
a
calming
of
that
part
of
the
market
difficulty
which
concerns
our
country,”
Mr
Monti
said.
He
has
already
won
considerable
support
from
the
Italian
public
and
enthusiastic
backing
from
outside
Italy.
Angela
Merkel
–
the
German
chancellor
who
had
a
particularly
difficult
time
dealing
with
Silvio
Berlusconi,
the
departing
prime
minister
–
said
she
valued
Mr
Monti
highly
and
looked
forward
to
meeting
him
soon.
“The
weeks
ahead
will
be
decisive,”
French
president
Nicolas
Sarkozy
told
Mr
Monti
in
a
letter.
“Together
we
will
succeed.
I
am
convinced
that
the
implementation
of
new
measures
on
top
of
those
already
adopted
will
restore
confidence
and
allow
the
return
of
stability
and
growth.”
Mr
Monti
will
present
his
government’s
as
yet
unexplained
economic
programme
to
the
senate
today
for
a
vote
of
confidence,
with
the
procedure
expected
to
be
repeated
in
the
lower
house
tomorrow.
Even
with
the
arrival
of
Italy’s
new
government,
yields
on
its
benchmark
10-year
bonds
remained
just
above
the
critical
7
per
cent
level.
The
premium
Rome
pays
over
Berlin
to
borrow
was
at
528
basis
points,
close
to
euro-era
records.
Other
eurozone
bond
markets
saw
a
sell-off
but
it
was
milder
than
Tuesday’s,
with
French,
Spanish
and
Belgian
yields
all
rising.
Boeing
lands
record
jet
order
.
Boeing
on
Sunday
won
its
single
largest
commercial
aircraft
order
when
Emirates,
the
fast-growing
Gulf
carrier,
announced
it
would
buy
at
least
50
twin-aisle
passenger
jets
from
the
US
manufacturer.
The
order
for
50
Boeing
777
long-haul
aircraft
is
worth
$18bn
at
list
prices,
a
record
contract
by
value
for
the
company.
Unveiled
at
the
Dubai
air
show,
it
provides
a
much-needed
boost
for
Boeing,
which
has
been
badly
trailing
Airbus
–
its
arch
rival
–
in
the
number
of
orders
won
this
year.
The
contract
also
underlines
the
ambitions
of
Emirates,
the
Dubai-based
carrier
that
is
rapidly
becoming
a
rival
to
Asian,
European
and
US
airlines.
Emirates
has
a
fleet
of
162
aircraft
and
is
already
the
biggest
operator
of
Boeing’s
777
aircraft
and
Airbus’s
A380
superjumbos.
Jim
Albaugh,
head
of
Boeing’s
commercial
aircraft
division,
said
Boeing’s
single
largest
order
by
value
in
its
95-year
history
was
an
“extremely
proud
moment”,
adding
that
the
deal
would
sustain
several
thousand
jobs
in
the
US.
Sheikh
Ahmed
Bin
Saeed
Al
Maktoum,
Emirates’
chief
executive,
said
the
777
order
was
part
of
the
airline’s
strategy
to
expand
across
Africa,
Asia,
Europe
and
the
US.
Emirates
is
buying
50
Boeing
777-300
ER
planes,
which
seat
365
passengers,
and
deliveries
of
the
aircraft
will
start
in
2015.
Although
the
order
is
worth
$18bn
at
list
prices,
Emirates
is
expected
to
pay
significantly
less
because
airlines
typically
secure
discounts
on
large
deals.
Boeing’s
previous
record
single
order
was
a
2006
deal
with
Air-India
for
68
aircraft,
worth
$11bn
at
list
prices.
Emirates
has
taken
out
options
on
a
further
20
Boeing
777-300
ER
planes,
which
means
the
order’s
value
could
rise
to
$26bn
at
list
prices.
Man
Group
recruits
top
China
businesswoman
for
mainland
push.
Man
Group,
the
world’s
second-
largest
hedge
fund
manager,
is
positioning
itself
for
an
expansion
into
mainland
China
as
part
of
a
drive
beyond
its
base
in
Europe
and
the
Middle
East.
The
FTSE
100
listed
group,
which
has
suffered
over
the
past
quarter
from
a
painful
fall
in
assets
under
management,
due
in
large
part
to
the
eurozone
crisis,
has
hired
Yifei
Li,
one
of
China’s
leading
businesswomen,
as
its
“China
chair”
to
oversee
the
push.
Ms
Yifei
is
the
former
head
of
MTV
in
China
and
the
chief
representative
in
the
country
of
its
parent
company,
Viacom.
Ms
Yifei
will
work
with
Pierre
Lagrange,
co-founder
of
Man-owned
GLG
Partners,
who
was
made
Asia
chairman,
a
new
position,
by
the
company
last
month.
Mr
Lagrange
has
been
joined
by
David
Mercurio,
a
former
senior
portfolio
manager
at
Singapore’s
Government
Investment
Corporation,
the
$100bn
sovereign
wealth
fund,
who
is
Man’s
new
head
of
Asia
Equity.
“We
take
the
view
that
China
is
going
to
be
a
very
big
part
of
growth
for
the
world.
It
is
a
perfect
time
to
expand
there,”
Mr
Lagrange
told
the
Financial
Times.
The
company
has
a
“5-10
year”
strategic
view,
said
Mr
Lagrange,
but
sources
familiar
with
Man’s
plans
say
it
hopes
to
open
a
fully-fledged
research
and
trading
office
in
Beijing
in
the
near
future.
However,
the
company
must
first
be
granted
licences
by
Chinese
authorities.
“We’re
already
doing
quite
a
lot
of
Asian
investments,”
says
Mr
Lagrange,
“but
further
down
the
road
we
will
have
Asian-centric
equity
long
short
funds
and
more
resources
on
the
ground”.
China
is
already
a
“huge
source
of
intelligence”
for
Man’s
funds,
Mr
Lagrange
said.
The
company
has
on-the-ground
observers
monitoring
production
at
factories
or
consumption
in
luxury
goods
outlets,
for
example.
Asia
has
become
a
much
less
risky
place
to
invest,
says
Mr
Lagrange.
“Ten
years
ago
the
big
determinants
of
emerging
market
prices
were
macro
factors
and
flows,”
he
says.
“It’s
reversed.
Now
those
are
what
dominate
investing
in
Europe.”
Expansion
in
China
remains
a
desirable
but
difficult
objective
for
many
hedge
fund
managers,
however.
While
some
have
established
sizeable
offices
in
Hong
Kong
–
including
Man,
which
already
has
a
60-person
operation
there
–
few
have
ventured
on
to
the
mainland.
European
banks
feel
the
effects
of
funding
crunch.
The
funding
hole
for
European
banks
is
deepening
following
a
sharp
fall
in
bond
issuance
this
year
as
market
turmoil
leads
to
a
region-wide
credit
crunch.
European
banks
have
sold
$413bn
worth
of
bonds
this
year,
equivalent
to
just
two-thirds
of
the
$654bn
that
is
due
to
be
returned
to
investors
in
2011
as
the
debts
mature,
according
to
data
compiled
for
the
Financial
Times
by
Dealogic.
That
leaves
the
banks
with
a
$241bn
funding
gap
in
2011,
the
first
time
European
lenders
have
collectively
been
unable
to
replace
their
maturing
debt
with
new
bonds
for
at
least
the
past
five
years.
Investors
say
they
have
been
deterred
from
buying
bank
bonds
due
to
uncertainty
over
the
financial
health
of
some
banks,
the
fate
of
the
eurozone
and
the
impact
of
new
financial
regulation.
The
funding
freeze
has
raised
fears
about
the
knock-on
effects
for
companies
reliant
on
bank
funding
and
the
broader
economy.
“Some
deleveraging
after
the
financial
crisis
is
clearly
needed,
but
I
think
banks
are
being
sent
on
a
crash
diet
that
will
have
wider
implications,”
said
Morgan
Stanley
analyst
Huw
van
Steenis.
“It’s
not
just
the
risk
of
a
European
credit
crunch,
it
will
have
a
knock-on
effect
in
Asia
and
the
US.”
Morgan
Stanley
estimates
that
banks
will
have
to
dispose
of
as
much
as
$3,300bn
worth
of
assets
over
the
next
few
years
to
meet
new
regulations
on
the
amount
of
capital
buffers
they
hold
and
to
address
the
funding
shortfall.
The
banks’
funding
difficulties
and
shrinking
balance
sheets
are
being
monitored
with
mounting
concern
by
the
European
Central
Bank,
which
is
considering
a
number
of
new
supportive
measures.
It
is
worried
about
the

Banks
face
an
even
greater
redemption
hump
next
year,
when
$720bn
worth
of
debt
is
due
to
mature.
The

data

so-called

traditionally
the

of

It

the
bundled
packages
of
loans
and
mortgages
that
have
become
increasingly
popular
for
banks
to
issue.
Including
such
debt,
European

sold
$744bn

this

Joint ‘eurobonds’ proposed
to
calm
markets.
The
introduction
of
a
joint
“eurobond”
that
would
entirely
replace
national
issuance
by
individual
members
of
the
single
currency
area
could
offer
the
best
solution
for
policymakers
seeking
a
more
stable
sovereign
debt
market,
according
to
a
study
by
the
European
Commission.
The
analysis,
obtained
by
the
Financial
Times
ahead
of
its
publication
on
Wednesday,
argues
that
the
creation
of
commonly
backed
“stability
bonds”
would
ensure
all
eurozone
members
could
meet
their
financing
needs
and
create
a
vast
market
that
could
compete
with
US
treasuries
as
a
global
benchmark.
“This
approach
would
be
most
effective
in
delivering
the
benefits
of
stability
bond
issuance,”
the
report
says.
“The
full
substitution
of
stability
bond
issuance
for
national
issuance
would
assure
full
refinancing
for
all
member
states
irrespective
of
the
condition
of
their
national
public
finances.”
The
complete
substitution
of
national
bonds
for
so-called
“eurobonds”
is
one
of
three
options
outlined
in
the
study.
The
report
ackn­ow­ledges
that
the
move
would
require
extensive
changes
in
European
Union
treaties
that
could
delay
its
implementation
for
years.
In
addition,
such
extensive
pooling
of
sovereign
debt
has
been
fiercely
resisted
in
Germany,
where
officials
believe
it
would
relieve
market
pressure
on
profligate
eurozone
countries,
allowing
weak
economies
to
become
“free
riders”
on
the
strong
credit
rating
of
Germany.
Still,
senior
EU
officials
believe
Germany
can
be
persuaded
if
the
scheme
includes
strict
rules
over
sovereign
spending,
and
the
Commission
report
includes
proposals
for
vastly
expanding
Brussels’
authority
over
national
budgets.
China’s
aluminium
imports
predicted
to
soar
by
2020.
China
will
import
more
than
1m
tonnes
of
aluminium
a
year
by
the
end
of
the
decade,
according
to
forecasts
from
CRU,
a
leading
commodities
consultancy.
In
a
report
on
the
long-term
outlook
for
the
metal,
the
consultancy
predicted
that
the
appreciation
of
the
renminbi,
combined
with
higher
prices
for
energy,
labour
and
raw
materials,
would
make
China’s
vast
aluminium
industry
less
competitive.
The
future
role
of
China
in
the
aluminium
market
is
a
subject
of
heated
debate
among
analysts,
traders
and
producers.
The
country
is
the
world’s
largest
producer
and
consumer
of
aluminium,
accounting
for
roughly
40
per
cent
of
the
global
market
of
40m
tonnes
a
year.
Until
2007,
it
was
a
large
net
exporter
of
the
metal.
However,
since
then
its
aluminium
trade
has
been
largely
balanced,
apart
from
an
opportunistic
wave
of
imports
in
2009,
with
Chinese
smelters
selling
to
the
domestic
manufacturing
industry,
which
is
in
turn
a
large
exporter
of
semi-finished
aluminium
products.
CRU
predicted
that
net
Chinese
imports
of
aluminium
would
rise
to
1.4m
tonnes
in
2020,
compared
to
just
70,000
tonnes
last
year.
“In
the
next
decade
we
predict
China
will
not
be
able
to
keep
pace
with
its
demand
growth,”
the
consultancy
said.
“The
task
will
then
fall
to
producers
in
the
world
ex-China
to
meet
the
supply
shortfall.”
The
prediction,
while
bullish
for
non-Chinese
aluminium
producers
such
as
Rusal,
Alcoa,
and
Rio
Tinto,
is
more
conservative
than
some
other
forecasts.
CRU
predicts
that
net
imports
will
remain
small,
below
200,000
tonnes,
until
2015.
Some
analysts
and
producers
believe
large
Chinese
imports
could
come
much
sooner,
as
the
country’s
aluminium
smelters,
some
of
which
count
as
the
highest
cost
producers
in
the
industry,
are
forced
out
of
business
by
rising
power
prices.
Inventories
of
the
metal
at
Shanghai
Futures
Exchange
warehouses
have
fallen
sharply,
to
their
lowest
since
February
2008.
On
Monday,
Rusal,
the
world’s
top
producer
of
aluminium,
said
that
10-15
per
cent
of
global
output
would
be
mothballed
in
the
first
half
of
next
year
if
prices
were
to
remain
at
current
levels.
Chinese
imports
could
support
prices,
traders
say,
although
the
impact
is
likely
to
be
counterbalanced
by
large
stockpiles
of
the
metal
in
the
west.
